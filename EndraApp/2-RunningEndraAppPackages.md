# Running Endra App Packages

## Download

You can download Endra from the following sources:

- https://github.com/emendir/EndraApp/releases

### Download Choice

There are multiple build artifacts of various distribution formats for various operating systems and CPU architectures.
For some operating systems, multiple builds of different package types are available.

Some builds are portable standalone executable binaries, and either have no filename extensions, or have the filename extension `.exe` in the case of Windows.
Other builds are of specific distribution formats as indicated by their filename extensions (e.g. `.flatpak`, `.apk`)

Choose a build appropriate for your operating system and CPU architecture.

## Install

If your chosen distribution format requires it, install it.
Executable binaries do not need to be installed.

## Run

For executable binaries, ensure the file permissions allow running it as a program.
Then, double-click or run the file in the terminal.

For other packaging formats, run the installed app as appropriate for the distribution format and operating system.

[You can configure the way EndraApp runs using environment variables.](4-EnvironmentVariables.md)
